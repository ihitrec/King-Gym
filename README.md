# King Gym

King Gym website is designed for current members and people looking to join a gym and wish to know more about the schedule, training available and all other information.

This is the first project in Code Institute Full Stack Developer program based on HTML, CSS and optional frameworks like Bootstrap.

## UX

### User stories

1. As a potential **new** gym customer I want to easily find information on the following: locations, pricing, customer testimonials and contact details. Having an image gallery that showcases the look of the gym as well as the people that are attending is a plus. Idealy there would be an option to book a free training before having to commit.

2. As an **exisisting** gym user I want to get information such as working hours and gym class schedule.

### Optimisation

- Images were converted to JPG to make the load time quicker
- Meta discription tag was added for better SEO
